# Session 3: Qiskit, introduction to quantum errors and error mitigation

## Setup Instructions
- Make sure you create a virtual environment before running the code. This is optional, but working with virtual environments is a good practice. Create a virtual environment using the following command:
    ```bash
    python -m venv my_virtual_env
    ```
- To ensure that you use the virtual environment, activate it using the following command:
    ```bash
    source my_virtual_env/bin/activate
    ```
    - **NOTE:** For Windows, use the following command:
        ```bash
        my_virtual_env\Scripts\activate
        ```
- The packages required to run the code are mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file. Install the required packages using the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- When using Jupyter Notebooks, make sure to choose the kernel that corresponds to the virtual environment you created (if you created one).
